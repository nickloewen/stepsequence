StepSequence
============

Code for an audio art installation. In-gallery motion governs the speed of a step sequencer.

* StepSequence contains the current code, which is a fairly functional demonstration of the audio end of the project
* BPMDelayADSRSynthTest is an out-of-date early version, which attempted the same task
